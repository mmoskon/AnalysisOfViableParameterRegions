#Computational AnalysisOfViable Parameter Regions In Models Of Synthetic Biological Systems

A computational approach for glocal analysis of viable parameter regions in biological gene regulatory network models. The methodology is based on the exploration of high-dimensional viable parameter spaces with genetic algorithms and local sampling in the direction of proncipal components.  

### Prerequisites

The source code is written in

* python 3.7 with [deap](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 

## Running the tests

To run the test a GRN model must be specified.  

```
python solver.py
```
